### **Overview**

At the Centre for Strategic Futures (CSF), we believe in actively seeking out diverse and fresh perspectives to guide policy-making in the Singapore government and better prepare ourselves for the future. These perspectives can be in terms of process – new foresight and risk methodologies – or content. We interact and exchange views with a wide range of people to help us uncover biases and blind spots for Singapore, and generate new insights about our operating environment.

CSF meets over 200 thought leaders yearly through incoming visits, overseas trips, paid consultancies, interviews and curated events. We also meet regularly with futurists from various parts of the Singapore government to share best practices and build up the practice of foresight within government.

### **Programmes**

#### **Distinguished Visitors Programme**

Introduced in 2014, the Distinguished Visitors Programme brings thought leaders to Singapore to engage in extensive discussions with senior decision makers in the Public Service.

Past Distinguished Visitors include:
* **Mariana Mazzucato,** Professor in Economics of Innovation at the University of Sussex and author of _The Entrepreneurial State: debunking public vs private sector myths;_ 
* **Nassim Nicholas Taleb,** author of _Black Swan_ and _Antifragile,_ and Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering, New York University;
* **Richard Bookstaber,** author of _The End of Theory and Option Pricing and Strategies in Investing_ and expert in financial risk management;

#### **Distinguished International Fellows Programme**

The Distinguished International Fellows Programme was set up to recognise long-time contacts of CSF who add value to our work by giving inputs to our practice of foresight, or help expand our networks. CSF currently has two Distinguished International Fellows:

* **Peter Schwartz,** Senior Vice President for Global Government Relations and Strategic Planning for Salesforce.com
* **Richard O’Neill,** President of the Highlands Group

#### **Other Contacts**

Other key contacts we had the privilege of working with in recent years include:

* **Catherine Fieschi,** Director of United Kingdom think-tank Counterpoint and former helm of the think-tank of the British Council
* **Itzik Ben Israel,** Chairperson of the Israel Space Agency
* **Parag Khanna,** author of _Connectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization_
* **Huw Price,** Academic Director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk
* **April Rinne,** Sharing Economy Advisor
* **David Skilling,** founding director of Landfall Strategy Group, an economic research and advisory firm

#### **CSF Fellows**

Initiated in 2015, CSF Fellows engages Ph.D. students from local universities in specific research projects. Besides tapping on their expertise, the CSF aims to provide opportunities to network with local academic institutions, carving the path for future collaborations based on mutual research interests. Examples of work carried out by the students would be conducting ethnographic interviews and subsequently analysing the results and implications in order to add to strategic planning.
