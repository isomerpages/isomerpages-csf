#### **Driving Forces Cards 2035**


The Driving Forces (DF) Cards 2035 was produced in 2016 to spark conversations on the key forces of change that will shape Singapore's operating environment in the next 20 years. It combines the Environmental Scanning and Sense Making SP+ tools to identify trends and potential disruptors that could impact the global order, the way people live, work and interact, and how governments operate in this time frame. The cards are not intended to be exhaustive, but offer alternative ways to think about the future.
