#### **ESI Project 2.0**


The ESI Project 2.0 was inspired by consulting firm Arup's Drivers of Change cards to present our top 48 Emerging Strategic Issues (ESIs) on a deck of cards we called the Future Deck. This was designed to trigger conversations on public policy, emerging issues and trends.
